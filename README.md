# led-saber
LED sword controller unit

This code is really scrappy in some places but it got the job done!

## Setup

Tested using the Arduino 1.8.19 IDE

## Dependencies

Requires the [Adafruit NeoPixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) library to controll the LED-strip.

## Known bugs / To fix

- Exiting the third mode (lightsaber mode) sometimes does not reset properly. This makes it so that the mode cannot be entered again without a hard reset / power cycle.
